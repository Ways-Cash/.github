## What is WAYS

WAYS is a stealth address protocol built for Solana. It lets anyone send SPL tokens or cross-chain USDC to a private, one-time-use address derived from the receiver’s main wallet. No new wallets to manage. No links to public identity.

Just a clean, private way to receive funds.

Every payment lands in an address only the receiver can access. On-chain activity remains verifiable, but completely unlinkable.

## Why it matters

Public wallets expose your entire financial footprint. That shouldn’t be the default.

WAYS brings privacy back to crypto without adding complexity. No trusted parties. No wrapped tokens. No browser extensions. It's simple, self-custodial, and programmable.

Whether you're accepting payments, managing treasury flows, or running on-chain operations, WAYS keeps your real address out of sight.

## How it works

1. Go to [ways.cash](https://ways.cash) and connect your wallet
2. Generate a stealth payment link
3. Share it or embed it in an invoice
4. Receive funds privately
5. Withdraw directly into your wallet with no trail

No additional apps. No account registration. No one watching.
