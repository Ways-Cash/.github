## What is WAYS

WAYS is a stealth address protocol for Solana. It enables unlinkable, one-time-use token accounts derived from a user's main wallet. No new wallet setup. No revealing your identity. Just a clean, private way to receive funds.

Every WAYS payment is routed to a unique address that only the intended receiver can control. No public trace. No on-chain footprint tied to your actual wallet.

---

## Why it matters

On-chain activity is transparent by design. But transparency shouldn't come at the cost of privacy.

WAYS gives individuals and organizations a way to receive payments without exposing wallet histories, balances, or affiliations. The system is non-custodial, efficient, and chain-native. It works without extra browser extensions, and integrates easily with existing workflows.

Whether you're an independent contributor, protocol operator, or treasury lead — you should be able to transact without leaking your financial graph.
